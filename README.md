## What is TripTrakr?
TripTrakr is an n-tier MVC web application to save and organize details of international trips (dates, countries, places, people, highlights) to better remember them. To protect privacy, users can only see information created in their own account.

## How to use TripTrakr
After registering an account, users begin by adding people (travel companions or people who were visited) and countries visited to the application. After the person and country that will be included in a trip have been added, the user can then add the trip details (travel dates, places visited, special memories). The ability to add photos to the trips is a planned feature.

## Getting Started
TripTrakr Web MVC was created using C# and .NET Framework (v 4.8) in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019.
